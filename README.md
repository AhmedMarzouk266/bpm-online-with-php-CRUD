# bpm-online-with-php-CRUD

The project is a simple implementation of CRUD operations to bpm'online
collections.

#how it works ?

The operations are made by sending HTTP requests to the bpm'online
service.
link example:
'(BPMonline) (application address)/0/ServiceModel/EntityDataService.svc/'

through OData protocol:
http://www.odata.org/

using cURL Library in PHP (http://php.net/curl).

#installing:
- it is supposed that php is on and running on your computer.
- copy the directory /www to your php projects folder.
- on the index.php file you can make your operations :

example of 'Reading' records from contact collection :


    BPM::getRecords('ContactCollection');


- Note :

getRecords() function does not return the records, it saves them in XML file 
called 'resultsFile.xml'.

example of 'Creating' record to contact collection :


    $contact->name='Test 24';
    $contact->phone='000 000 000';
    $contact->createRecord('ContactCollection');


example of 'Updating' record to contact collection :

    $contact2 = new BPM();
    $contact2->guid ='00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';
    // guid here is a 36 charecter id for every contact, generated by bpm'online page
    $contact2->name='Updated oop contact';
    $contact2->updateRecord('ContactCollection');
    
example of 'Deleting' record to contact collection :

    $contact2->guid ='00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';
    BPM::deleteRecord('ContactCollection',$guid);

- Project contents :

/www:
1- BPM.php : it is the main class that contains all the operations and some helper functions.
2- config.php : contains the configuration system.
3- resultsFile.xml : contains the results got back from the getRecords() function
4- index.php : where you can make your operations.

good luck !
